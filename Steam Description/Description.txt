[h1]Antenna Relay and Radar[/h1]

[h1]Block Communication[/h1]
[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=391453613] This script [/url] can be used to send and receive messages, filter detected grids, and execute actions based on detected grids.
Messages can be sent from one programmable block to another. Block communication will use antenna relay to send messages to other grids.
Block Communication can read detected grid information, apply filters, execute actions, and write to a TextPanel.
For usage, see the script itself.

[h1]Settings[/h1]
The file at "%AppData%\SpaceEngineers\Storage\363880940.sbm_Autopilot\AutopilotSettings.txt" contains the settings for ARMS.
To reset a value to its default, simply delete it.
bAllowAutopilot - this mod can control the movement of grids
bAllowRadar - radar can be used to detect grids, otherwise functions as a beacon
bUseRemoteControl - set to true if you want to use remote controls as Autopilot blocks
bAllowWeaponControl - Enables Weapon Control and E command
yParallelPathfinder - Number of pathfinding tasks that can run in parallel
fDefaultSpeed - the desired minimum speed, when not using V
fMaxSpeed - the maximum speed Autopilot is allowed to fly at
fMaxWeaponRange - the maximum range any weapon can be set to
sWeaponCommandsNPC - commands that N.P.C. weapons will use

[h1]Misc[/h1]
A solar array of panels or oxygen farms can be instructed to face the sun by adding [ Face Sun ] to the name of any solar panel or oxygen farm. See [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457179880] ARMS Demonstration World [/url].

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
These are all the known issues with ARMS. If an issue is not listed here, I do not know about it.

Merging grids will cause Autopilot to reset or cease functioning. All Autopilot blocks should be manually reset after a merge.

Autopilot cannot fly near / through hanger doors; piston and rotor doors will work.

The Phased array Radar model has a small texture issue on DX9.
